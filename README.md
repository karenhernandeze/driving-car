# Driving Car Minigame

A simple computer graphics application to showcase a 3D scene in which a vehicle can traverse a rugged terrain using keyboard arrow keys for navigation.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, `cd` into it and run `npm install` to install the required packages and dependencies.

## Usage

Run `npm run dev` to start a development server locally. It should automatically open the project in your default web browser. If it doesn't, navigate to [localhost at port 5173](http://localhost:5173/index.html) and you should see a colorful spinning cube.

## Scene

The project aims to model a car movign around a rugged terrain. It features but is not limited to:

- Car (top, body, wheels, lights)
- Reflector designed specifically for the car
- Rugged Terrain

Furthermore, the project incorporates advanced functionalities such as light and shadow physics, dynamic animation, and interactive elements, elevating the overall immersive experience. These aspects contribute to the authenticity and realism of the simulation, enhancing the user's engagement and interaction with the virtual environment.

## Functionality

To interact with the program, utilize the arrow keys on your keyboard, which have been designated to control the driving functions within the software.

## Tech stack

[![Threejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/threejs-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=three.js&logoColor=white)](https://threejs.org/)

We chose to work with the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) JavaScript 3D Library given it has a really simple abstraction layer over the complicated WebGL programming API and its steep learning curve.

It is one of the most popular and stable WebGL libraries out there, with a vast feature set, good documentation, plenty examples to learn from, great performance and ease of learning.

Although [Unity](https://unity.com/) was also available, we wanted to focus on the scene and not on the physics that it could involve. This is why we chose to use a simple render engine rather than a full-fledged, all-in-one game engine like Unity.
